# POC Component Library

Welcome to the **POC Component Library** documentation! This is a proof-of-concept implementation showcasing how to build, document, and maintain a modern React component library.

## 🎯 Purpose

This component library demonstrates:

- **Reusable React Components** with TypeScript
- **Monorepo Architecture** using pnpm workspaces
- **Component Documentation** with Storybook
- **Code Quality** with ESLint and shared configurations
- **Build System** with Vite and Turborepo
- **Private Publishing** to GitHub Packages

## 🏗️ Architecture

The library is organized as a monorepo with the following structure:

```
poc-component-library/
├── apps/
│   └── docs/                 # 📚 This Storybook documentation
├── packages/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── button/           # 🔘 Button component
│   └── config/
│       ├── eslint/           # 📏 Shared ESLint config
│       └── tsconfig/         # 🔧 Shared TypeScript config
```

## 📦 Available Components

### Button
A customizable button component with multiple variants and full TypeScript support.

**Features:**
- Primary and Secondary variants
- Click event handling
- Disabled state
- Full TypeScript definitions
- Accessible markup

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use these components in your project:

1. **Install the component:**
   ```bash
   pnpm add @poc/button
   ```

2. **Import and use:**
   ```tsx
   import { Button } from '@poc/button';

   function App() {
     return (
       <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert('Hello!')}>
         Click me!
       </Button>
     );
   }
   ```

## 🛠️ Development

This documentation is built with Storybook and serves as both:
- **Component Showcase** - Visual examples of all components
- **API Documentation** - Props, types, and usage examples
- **Design System Guide** - Consistent patterns and principles

Each component story demonstrates different use cases and provides interactive controls to explore component behavior.
