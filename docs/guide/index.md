# Component Library Implementation Guide

A comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building a production-ready component library with theming support and automated publishing.

## Guide Overview

This guide is divided into 10 phases that take you from a blank project to a fully functional, publishable component library:

### ðŸš€ Getting Started
- **[Prerequisites](./01-prerequisites.md)** - Required tools and setup
- **[Monorepo Foundation](./02-monorepo-setup.md)** - Setting up the project structure

### ðŸ§± Building Components  
- **[First Component](./03-first-component.md)** - Creating the Button component
- **[Storybook Setup](./04-storybook-setup.md)** - Centralized documentation
- **[Documentation App](./05-documentation-app.md)** - Vite + Storybook integration

### ðŸŽ¨ Theming & Advanced Features
- **[Testing & Verification](./06-testing-verification.md)** - Validating your setup
- **[Theming System](./07-theming-system.md)** - Implementing CSS custom properties theming
- **[Custom Themes](./08-custom-themes.md)** - How users can create their own themes

### ðŸ“¦ Distribution & Publishing
- **[Unified Package](./09-unified-package.md)** - Creating a complete library package
- **[Publishing Strategy](./10-publishing-strategy.md)** - GitHub-based distribution with versioning

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

- âœ… **Modern Monorepo**: pnpm + Turborepo + TypeScript
- âœ… **Component Library**: Reusable React components with proper exports
- âœ… **Theming System**: CSS custom properties with optional ThemeProvider
- âœ… **Documentation**: Storybook with hot reloading and auto-generated docs
- âœ… **Publishing Pipeline**: GitHub Package Registry with automated versioning
- âœ… **Developer Experience**: ESLint, TypeScript, and proper build tooling

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed
- Git and GitHub account
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript
